gitting-started
===============

This is git intro I've created for co-workers who are migrating to git, but I've tried to make it generic enough to be helpful for anyone. I would like this to be a living document, so please post issues (or make pull requests) if you have better methods, or if you see any mistakes or outdated content. I will post the file as a the sourced file in ODP format (OpenOffice and LibreOffice Presentation file) and later PDF for portable, read-only access. Thanks
