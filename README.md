gitting-started
===============
This is a git tutorial I created for co-workers who are migrating to git, but I made it generic enough for anyone to learn git. I assume the reader has a general idea of software version control practices, but little to no git knowledge. Examples are designed to be worked through during the presentation, so play along at home, won't you? Included in the download is the source file in ODP format ([OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/) and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) presentation file) and later I'll have a PDF for more portable, read-only access. Thanks
